Here are syntax highlighting files for the BLUPF90 family of programs.

OS's: Mac OS X or Linux

1. Make it an executable on Mac or Linux:
```  $ chmod 775 installQMSimSyntax ```
2. Run the bash script with:
```  $./installQMSimSyntax ```
3. While in vim you might want to use the following in command mode
``` :set syntax=par ```

in the same directory you saved the other 2 files.
